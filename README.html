<h2>Research Interests</h2>
I am researching cloud and IoT.  I want to help society with cloud technology.<br>
And I want to use technology to solve social issues.<br>
I'm particularly interested in Fog cloud and edge computing in the cloud.<br>  
I'm also researching content offload WiFi APs that can access content<br>
other than WiFi APs that access cellular lines and the Internet when there is heavy traffic.<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2>Projects</h2>
2019 – 2020 JO SPOT 2 (BOOK SPOT!) Solved the problem of information disparity<br>
due to economic disparity in developing countries. I used the Raspberry Pi to <br>
build an electronic library of out-of-copyright books. Then, we succeeded in <br>
developing an environment where Cambodian children can access the electronic <br>
library on their iPads and PCs and read many books for free.<br><br><br>
  
2018 – 2019 JO SPOT At the time of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, it was expected <br>
that access to content would become more difficult, assuming an increase <br>
in the amount of Internet traffic in Tokyo due to an increase in tourists not only from Japan <br>
but also from overseas. And as a workaround, we considered WiFI AP, which features content offload, <br>
which is the independent distributed information WiFi infrastructure JO SPOT.<br>
